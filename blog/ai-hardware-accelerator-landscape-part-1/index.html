  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>CPUs and GPUs have been at the center of the AI boom, and the capabilities of AI models have grown exponentially while running on these traditional processors. With all of the impressive LLMs and generative-AI models available today, it is easy to forget we are still in the early days of AI. Future AI models will need significantly more processing power.</p>
<p>We have the deepest respect for the engineers who have stretched CPU and GPU hardware and software to support AI workloads. But CPU and GPU architectures were never designed for AI, and we are increasingly hitting limits in efficiency and power consumption. Inference costs are inflated by running on hardware architected for other applications. A new kind of architecture is needed to run AI efficiently.</p>
<p>In this three-post series we lay out a path to efficient AI. <strong>In this post we focus on the custom hardware required.</strong> The second post will dig into the software gap that makes new hardware hard to use, and the third will explain why an open-source community is the key to closing that gap.</p>

<h3 id="why-traditional-processors-cannot-efficiently-run-ai-workloads">Why Traditional Processors Cannot Efficiently Run AI Workloads</h3>
<p>The power demand of AI inference is growing exponentially—entire power plants are being planned to feed AI datacenters. Over the past few years teams have focused on building the latest LLMs rather than reducing the cost of older models, but now that many models are maturing, efficiency matters.</p>
<p>Why not simply enhance traditional processors? In one sense we already do: CPUs and GPUs sprout ever-larger tensor cores and AI “springs.” Still, the underlying architectures remain general purpose.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/ai-hardware-accelerator-landscape/part1/cpu-gpu-architectures.png" alt="CPU and GPU architectures"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPUs</strong> excel at control-heavy general-purpose workloads thanks to branch prediction, deep caches, and rich instruction sets, but they devote relatively little silicon to multiply-accumulate (MAC) units.</li>
<li><strong>GPUs</strong> were designed for massive graphics workloads. A single control unit drives thousands of arithmetic units, but GPUs carry datapaths, registers, and memory bandwidth tuned for high-precision graphics and training, not low-precision inference. Much of the silicon—and power budget—goes unused during inference.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="diving-into-specialized-ai-hardware">Diving into Specialized AI Hardware</h3>
<p>The alternative is a dedicated AI hardware accelerator, often called a <strong>Neural Processing Unit (NPU)</strong>. Vendors target three segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge inference</strong> — from phones to cameras.</li>
<li><strong>Datacenter inference</strong> — latency-critical services at scale.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong> — the bleeding edge, though today’s post focuses on inference.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/blog/ai-hardware-accelerator-landscape/part1/generic-npu.png" alt="Generic NPU diagram"></p>
<p>Compared with GPUs, NPUs devote an even larger fraction of die area to compute and drastically simplify control. Key architectural themes are shared across devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiled dataflow.</strong> Tensors are partitioned so data stays close to compute, reducing costly movements up and down the memory hierarchy.</li>
<li><strong>Memory hierarchy tuning.</strong> Designers juggle DDR vs HBM, SRAM vs cache, and the width/number of on-chip networks to balance bandwidth, capacity, and cost.</li>
<li><strong>Low-precision arithmetic.</strong> AI inference tolerates error; int-8, fp-8, and even 4-bit weights slash energy per MAC.</li>
<li><strong>Compute-to-control ratio.</strong> Hardware ranges from tiny edge chips (&lt; 100 GB/s off-chip bandwidth) to 100 TB/s datacenter behemoths, but all push more MACs behind fewer control units than GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p>No single set of trade-offs is best for every model: LLMs may require inter-device fabrics to keep CPUs out of the data path, while computer-vision models might prefer smaller tiles and on-chip SRAM.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="implications-to-the-ai-ecosystem">Implications to the AI Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Hardware efficiency is only half the battle. Two software hurdles stand in the way of widespread NPU adoption:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compiler maturity.</strong> ML compilers must generate kernels that outperform hand-tuned GPU libraries. Rapidly evolving model architectures outpace monolithic compiler teams, so kernel-level plug-ins are essential.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-device compatibility.</strong> Over 50 companies build custom inference silicon. Without a common software substrate spanning NPUs, CPUs, and GPUs—as well as training and inference—few teams will risk migrating.</li>
</ol>
<p>As NPU hardware and software mature we expect <strong>hundreds-fold efficiency gains</strong> for models rewritten to exploit NPUs fully.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The promise of more-efficient AI hinges on an advanced open-source software stack. Custom NPU hardware is remarkable, but running models across a diverse hardware landscape requires software. A widening software gap threatens even the largest hardware players.</p>
<p>In <strong>Part 2</strong> we will unpack why teams struggle to build software for new AI hardware—and why efficiency alone is not enough. Learn more about Kernelize’s vision for an open-source NPU ecosystem around Triton at <strong><a href="https://kernelize.ai">kernelize.ai</a></strong>.</p>
